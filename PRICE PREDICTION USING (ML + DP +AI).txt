Project Title
Hybrid Stock Price Prediction System Using Time-Series Analysis and Sentiment Integration

Project Objectives
Predict future stock prices in the Indian stock market with high accuracy.
Combine historical stock data analysis with market sentiment to enhance prediction reliability.
Develop a user-friendly web or desktop application to visualize predictions.
Project Description
This project involves building a hybrid stock price prediction system that integrates time-series modeling with sentiment analysis. The system uses:

Historical stock price data for patterns and trends.
News and social media sentiment data to account for market-driving events.
Machine learning and deep learning algorithms for prediction.
Project Workflow
Data Collection:

Stock Data: Use APIs like NSEpy, Alpha Vantage, or Yahoo Finance to collect historical price and volume data for Indian stocks.
Sentiment Data: Scrape news headlines and social media posts (e.g., Twitter using Tweepy or official APIs).
Data Preprocessing:

Clean and format the stock data (handle missing values, normalize).
Perform sentiment analysis on text data (e.g., using VADER, TextBlob, or fine-tuned BERT models).
Combine stock and sentiment data into a unified dataset.
Feature Engineering:

Extract features like moving averages, RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
Add sentiment scores as features.
Model Development:

Time-Series Model: Use ARIMA or LSTM for historical price trend prediction.
Sentiment Analysis Integration: Combine sentiment-derived features with historical data for enhanced prediction.
Final Model: Use Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) or Transformers for the combined dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
Compare results with baseline models (e.g., linear regression or standalone ARIMA).
Visualization:

Build an interactive dashboard (using tools like Flask/Django for web, or Tkinter for desktop).
Display:
Predicted prices.
Sentiment analysis results.
Trends and visual insights like candlestick charts.
Deployment:

Deploy the system on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku).
Tools and Technologies
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript (for web front-end, if required).
Libraries:
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy.
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM.
Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch.
Sentiment Analysis: VADER, TextBlob, or Hugging Face Transformers.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash.
APIs: NSEpy, Alpha Vantage, Tweepy.
Deployment: Flask/Django, Streamlit for dashboards, or cloud services.

Deliverables
Prediction Model:
Integrated model combining time-series forecasting and sentiment analysis.
Dashboard:
Interactive visualization of stock price trends and predictions.

Documentation:
Include methodology, codebase, and future scope.
Expected Outcomes
A working prototype that predicts stock prices with higher accuracy than standalone models.
Insights into the influence of sentiment on market trends.
Practical exposure to hybrid modeling and application deployment.
